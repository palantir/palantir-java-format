fix:
  description: 'Method chains in initializers may once again be laid onto a single
    next line, if they are short enough. This fixes a regression from #123 (0.3.11)
    where the column limit for method chains would prevent us from attempting to put
    the initializer on the 2nd line first and see if that works.'
