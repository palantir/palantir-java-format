  description: "When inlining a level's leading docs, check that no breaks were introduced
    more robustly.\n\nWe already did some validation that the leading docs \n (1)
    don't contain forced breaks, and\n (2) can fit onto the current line\nHowever
    with the new logic added in #71, inner levels might decide to break even when
    the above two conditions are satisfied.\n\nWe guard against this by checking whether
    the state after the inlining of leading docs has recorded new lines, which would
    be caused by an inner break being taken."
